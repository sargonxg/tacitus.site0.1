                <p>
                    Most “future of work” tools assume that people will happily abandon existing workflows.
                    In reality, the global workforce still runs on email: hiring decisions, grievances,
                    escalations, negotiations, board packs, and diplomatic cables all move through the inbox.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Tacitus is email‑native by design. Instead of asking teams to adopt a new portal, it sits on top
                    of the infrastructure where decisions already happen, preserving institutional memory and
                    compliance trails while adding structure and insight.
                </p>

                    <h4>Production‑Ready, Not Prototype‑Only</h4>
                    <p>
                        Email has thirty years of security, identity, and audit infrastructure around it.
                        By integrating directly with enterprise providers (Gmail, O365/Exchange, IMAP),
                        Tacitus inherits these guarantees instead of rebuilding them in a bespoke app.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        That makes pilots less risky and production deployments more realistic.
                    </p>

                    <h4>The Substrate of Decision‑Making</h4>
                    <p>
                        Slides and dashboards present decisions once they are made; email captures the
                        argumentation that leads there – who raised which concern, who objected, and how
                        trade‑offs were framed. For conflict analysis, this temporal and narrative structure
                        matters more than final outcomes.

                    <h4>Adoption Without Friction</h4>
                    <p>
                        New conflict‑resolution tools often fail because they require new behaviour.
                        Tacitus minimises behavioural change: users keep writing emails; selected threads
                        are simply routed through the engine for structuring and analysis, under the control
                        of a human operator.

                <p>
                    Email‑native does not mean “email only.” Attachments, linked documents, and relevant
                    datasets are pulled into the same conflict graph. But using email as the spine of the
                    system gives Tacitus a stable, production‑ready backbone: identity, timestamps, and
                    conversational context are consistent and legally legible.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For organisations under regulatory, legal, or political scrutiny, that matters as much
                    as model performance.
