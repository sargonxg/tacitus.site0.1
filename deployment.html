                <p>
                    Tacitus is designed for conflicts that are too sensitive for a bot and too complex for a dashboard.
                    Below are concrete deployment patterns where an email‑native, multi‑agent conflict engine
                    makes a measurable difference in resolution quality and speed.

                <div class="card-cyber">
                    <h4>HR Investigations &amp; Workplace Harm</h4>
                    <p>
                        Months or years of emotionally loaded threads are normalised into audit‑ready timelines.
                        Tacitus aligns behaviours with policy clauses, prior cases, and local labour frameworks,
                        highlighting gaps in the factual record and questions that still require human follow‑up.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Typical users: HR investigations teams, ombudsperson offices, ethics and compliance units.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="card-cyber">
                    <h4>C‑Suite Strategy &amp; Board Alignment</h4>
                    <p>
                        Executive teams often argue from different mental models: spreadsheets versus mission,
                        quarter versus decade, risk versus legitimacy. Tacitus reconstructs the narrative field
                        from email: which frames are clashing, where interests overlap, and which options
                        preserve face for all parties.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Typical users: CEOs, chiefs of staff, strategy heads, board secretariats.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="card-cyber">
                    <h4>Diplomacy, Peacebuilding &amp; Multilateral Files</h4>
                    <p>
                        In complex political files, every word in a draft matters. Tacitus maps positions, red lines,
                        and symbolic language across delegations and time, retrieves analogous formulations from
                        previous agreements, and suggests compromise language consistent with stated interests and
                        institutional precedent.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Typical users: political affairs officers, envoys’ teams, mediation support units.
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="grid-3" style="margin-top: 2.4rem;">
                <div class="card-cyber">
                    <h4>Regulatory &amp; Risk Incidents</h4>
                    <p>
                        When regulators call, organisations scramble to reconstruct “who knew what, when” from email.
                        Tacitus accelerates this reconstruction, linking claims and decisions to specific artefacts
                        and timelines, while preserving a clear human‑readable chain of reasoning.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Typical users: risk, legal, internal audit, crisis management teams.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="card-cyber">
                    <h4>Political Campaigns &amp; Narrative Operations</h4>
                    <p>
                        Campaigns, advocacy coalitions, and public‑affairs teams operate inside overlapping narrative
                        battles. Tacitus ingests internal threads and selected media streams, surfacing how messages
                        land within the team and where internal misalignment is likely to spill into the public.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Typical users: campaign managers, communications directors, issue‑advocacy leads.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="card-cyber">
                    <h4>Transformations, Mergers &amp; Organisational Change</h4>
                    <p>
                        During restructuring or integration, rumours travel faster than official memos.
                        Tacitus maps emergent narratives about fairness, identity, and loss across email,
                        helping leaders address legitimate concerns early instead of reacting to full‑blown crises.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Typical users: transformation offices, integration teams, people &amp; culture leads.
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>

                <h2 class="section-heading">&gt;&gt; Deployment Shape</h2>
                <p>
                    In all of these scenarios, Tacitus operates as an internal analysis teammate:
                    connected to the organisation’s email ecosystem under strict access controls,
                    producing briefings, graphs, and scenario notes that a human mediator or leader
                    uses to shape next steps – never as an autonomous decision‑maker.
