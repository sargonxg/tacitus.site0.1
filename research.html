                <p>
                    Tacitus sits at the intersection of conflict resolution, organisational psychology,
                    and advanced AI systems. This space will host white papers, experimental results,
                    and implementation notes on how narrative‑aware AI can help humans find common ground
                    without erasing disagreement.

                    <h4>Deliberative &amp; “Habermas” Machines</h4>
                    <p>
                        We track work on AI‑supported deliberation, including research on “Habermas‑like”
                        systems that structure arguments and surface points of convergence in group debate.
                        Tacitus adapts these ideas to real‑world email corpora, where power asymmetries,
                        hierarchy, and fear of retaliation are part of the data.

                    <h4>Finding Common Ground Across Tribes</h4>
                    <p>
                        Research on bridging systems, deliberative polling, and common‑ground detection
                        informs how Tacitus scores candidate formulations and options. The aim is not
                        to push synthetic consensus, but to identify formulations that opposing sides
                        can live with, given their expressed values and constraints.

                    <h4>From RAG to Conflict Graphs</h4>
                    <p>
                        Standard retrieval‑augmented generation struggles with long, relational conflicts.
                        Tacitus experiments with graph‑based retrieval over claims, narratives, timelines,
                        and policies, and will publish benchmarks and ablation studies as the engine matures.
                    </p>

                <h2 class="section-heading">&gt;&gt; Open Questions</h2>
                <p>
                    How do you measure “resolution quality” rather than just response speed? What is a fair
                    way to model power and vulnerability in institutional conflicts? How transparent should
                    a conflict graph be to the people whose emails populate it?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Tacitus Lab engages with these questions in dialogue with practitioners and researchers.
                    If you are working on deliberative AI, conflict resolution, or institutional design,
                    we would love to compare notes.
